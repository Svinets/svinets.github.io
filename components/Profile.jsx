      Software engineer specializing in web development. I'm interested in building quick, efficient, and modular client-<br/>
      side environments to provide the best possible UX. I approach feature implementation as an iterative process, and<br/>
      my attention to detail and discipline for critiquing visuals require me to maintain my work to a high standard.<br/>
      <br/>
      Experienced with front-end frameworks - Angular, React/Redux, with strong fundamentals in HTML and CSS, and<br/>
      server-side technologies including Node/Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases with accompanying<br/>
      ODM/ORMs.
